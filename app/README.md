## Ride-For-Life Front End: A Motorcycle Ambulance service app (Lambda Build Week)

This is a React-redux project created for Lambda School's Build Week. 
One of the biggest obstacles women face while pregnant is getting to a health facility to safely deliver. 
Most people do not own a car or a motorcycle, and a majority live greater than 5 km from a health center (an hour by foot).
This app identifies and sends a text to the nearest motorcycle ambulance driver.


Current version is v1.
